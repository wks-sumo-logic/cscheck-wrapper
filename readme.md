Sumo Logic Health Check Wrapper
===============================

This is designed to allow a Customer Service to run Health Checks for a client base

Installing the Project
======================

These scripts are in bash, so installation for a Unix, Windows, or Unix system will be easy.
Currently setup for MacIntosh, the directories can be changed to suite

    1. Download and install git for your platform if you don't already have it installed.
       It can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    2. Open a new shell/command prompt. It must be new since only a new shell will include the new python 
       path that was created in step 1. Cd to the folder where you want to install the scripts.
    
    3. Clone this repo using the following command:
    
       git github.com:wks-sumo-logic/cscheck-wrapper.git

       This will create a new folder cscheck-wrapper
    
    6. Change into the cfg folder to specify all of the organizations you want too check

       <Organizational-Identifier>	<Deployment-Site>	<Client-Name>
       0000000000004608			tky			wayne_sumologic_sandbox
	
    7. Change into the etc directory and add you specific credentials if you wish
        
NOTE: This will place the output of the checks and their logs into $HOME/Downloads/HealthCheckOutput
      The script is designed to be run several times, and capture logs and output to compare
